# Multiple Disease Prediction System

# Description
This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict multiple diseases based on user-provided input, such as symptoms or medical history. It leverages advanced data analysis and classification algorithms to provide accurate and reliable predictions, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

# Features

- **Disease Coverage:** Predicts multiple diseases across various categories (e.g., chronic, infectious, lifestyle-related).
- **User-Friendly Input:** Accepts symptoms, vital stats, and medical history through an intuitive interface.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes supervised learning techniques like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks for classification.
- **Accuracy & Performance:** Optimized for high accuracy with preprocessed datasets and fine-tuned models.
- **Scalable Design:** Modular and extendable for integrating additional diseases and features.

# Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (or relevant libraries for ML)
- Flask/Django for the backend (if applicable)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end (if applicable)
- Datasets sourced from [mention sources, e.g., Kaggle, UCI repository].

# How It Works

1. Input Symptoms: Users enter their symptoms and relevant details.
2. Model Processing: The system runs the input through trained ML models.
3. Prediction: Outputs the probable disease(s) with confidence scores.

# Future Scope

- Expand the database for more diseases.
- Incorporate advanced techniques like ensemble models and deep learning.
- Add recommendations for treatments or specialist consultations.
